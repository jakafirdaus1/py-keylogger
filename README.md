# KeyLogger with Python (Educational Purposes)

<h2>Description</h2>
This projects consists of a simple Python sript that lead you to experience a basic threat in cybersecurity. A Python keylogger is a program written in Python designed to monitor and record keystrokes made by a user on a keyboard. It is often used for tracking user activity or debugging purposes but can also be misused for malicious activities such as stealing sensitive information like passwords and personal data.<br/><br/>

<b>This is intended strictly for educational or ethical purposes. Do not use it for illegal or malicious activities.</b>



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Virtual Environment</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

Create a folder named project and open the folder from visual studio code. Inside the folder create a file named keylogger.py. I recommend to run this program in a virtual environment so you dont have to allow keylogger threat from the virus & threat protection in your personal computer.</br></br>
